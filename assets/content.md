## About Pulda

We are a client-first company focused on holiday planning, with a unique network among localities around the world. Most people don't have much time to network and research about holiday destinations. This might lead to poor experience during their precious vacation time. We want to solve this problem by using an AI-centric approach. Users can use our app to select their budget categories, number of travellers as well as likes and dislikes, and we will create a custom travelling experience based on the AI algorithm. But we don't stop there. We partner with expert travellers and local guides to select potential destinations and lead customers in selected countries. All this will be packed up into separate packages, where users can choose to have self-guided or guided tours.
