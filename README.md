This is a website for a hypothetical company focused on holiday planning. Most people don't have much time to research about holiday destinations and discover localities around the world. This might lead to poor experience during their precious vacation time. The company partners with expert travellers and local guides to select potential destinations and lead customers in selected countries. All this will be packed up into separate packages, where users can choose to have self-guided or guided tours.
